What are the benefits of being able to help people sift through myriad availibilities.

People like movies, but most people don't like ALL movies. But how to choose? There are SOO MANY movies to choose from. If someone is looking for new movies to watch and settle on a movie that they won't enjoy then they are wasting their time. They're also wasting the resources used in providing the movie to the viewer. For example: If a Netflix viewer were to sift through movies on their own, there's a good chance they might settle on a dud, and become less satisfied with their streaming service. They might quit their subscription. AND Netflix just used their electricity and may have had to pay out for the publisher to stream the movie, to the effect of lowering a client's satisfaction. 

BUT!
If you can accurately predict what movies a viewer will like then you can weed out some of the viewer dissatisfaction. If a viewer is suggested movies that they will likely enjoy, then the client is more satisfied, will maintain subscription, and Netflix isn't wasting resources.

How do we accurately recommend movies that will please viewers? WITH MACHINE LEARNING OF COURSE!
